### 3. Data Collection Contract

Manages the secure gathering and validation of information required for regulatory reporting.

- **Features:**
    - Standard data schemas for compliance information
    - Encrypted data storage and transmission
    - Automated data validation rules
    - Data source verification
    - Audit trail for all collected information
    - Cross-reference verification with existing records

### 4. Report Generation Contract

Automatically compiles compliance data into standardized formats required by different regulatory bodies.

- **Features:**
    - Templatized report generation
    - Multi-format export capabilities (PDF, XML, JSON)
    - Regulatory-specific formatting
    - Version control for report drafts
    - Digital signature integration
    - Report accuracy verification

### 5. Submission Verification Contract

Records and verifies the timely filing of compliance reports with the appropriate regulatory authorities.
